Assignment 3

"GenStack.h"
"main.cpp"

Book was used to create the template class for the stack.
It can successfully hold any type of data and resize itself
if it becomes full.

I was able to figure out the first part to this assignment,
however I got confused on how to implement the stack while also
reading from the user file.

g++ *.cpp
./a.out (yourfilename.txt)
